# 2D Heat Conduction in a Thin Metallic Sheet – CHE212 Final Project

This project explores transient 2D heat conduction in a thin metallic sheet with a localized heat source, validated through experimental data and MATLAB simulations. Conducted as part of **CHE212: Heat Transfer** at IIT Kanpur.

**Mentor:** Prof. Anurag Tripathi

## ⚙️ Methodology

- **Setup**: 16×16 cm GI sheet (0.2 mm thick) with a cylindrical heater block
- **Sensors**: Five temperature sensors placed at known grid points
- **Data Acquisition**: Arduino-controlled with CoolTerm logging
- **Simulation**: MATLAB-based FDM solver used for solving 2D heat equation
